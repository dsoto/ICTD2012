% potential to lower installation and operating costs
This paper demonstrates a model for electricity
distribution in a rural context with the potential
to lower both installation and operating costs below
what a conventional grid extension would offer.
The microutility in this paper provides power on a
pre-paid basis similar to the way cellular phone
air-time is sold.
This system uses SMS messages sent 
over the GSM networks
for communication allowing installation in any place
within reach of a GSM tower.
Several of these individual microutilities are monitored
and administered via a central server.
These microutilities are currently installed and have been providing
power to approximately 170 households in Mali, 38 household
in Uganda since Spring of 2011.

\section{Introduction}
% 1.1 scope of rural electricity market
Modern electricity services are almost absent from rural
areas of developing countries.
Some 1.4 billion people lack access to electricity with 85\% of
them living in rural areas.\cite{WEO2010}
% 1.1.1 cited benefits of electricity
% 1.1.2 population without grid access
Rural customers gain access to energy services by purchasing
kerosene and drycell batteries and by paying for battery charging
services.
Survey data in the Millennium Villages show that these expenditures
are a significant fraction of household spending.\cite{MVPEnergy}
Despite this evidence of spending on energy services,
grid extension has not occurred in many areas.
Even modest levels of electricity bring the benefits of clean lighting
and communication through cellphones.\cite{Cabraal:2005}
Higher levels of electricity allow for mechanized power and can
directly increase incomes in rural areas.\cite{Kirubi:2009}

One barrier to the extension of the existing grid to rural areas is cost.
Grid extension costs can exceed \$2000 USD per household, prohibitively
high even for many governments in developing
nations.\cite{ModiPlanningKenya}
Moreover, grid extension requires that capital be allocated in large
lump sums to pay for the installation of the expensive, high voltage power
lines in remote areas that are necessary prior to individual connections.
Even if capital costs are raised and grid extensions constructed,
reading meters and collecting tariffs in remote locations pose
significant logistical problems, driving up operating and maintenance
costs for power customers.

% 1.2.2
Lacking grid connections, customers turn to costly alternatives for
power: batteries, kerosene, solar panels and travel to grid connected
locations are relied upon for services that would be more efficiently
(and usually cleanly) delivered via a grid connection.
Such substitutions are often at a much higher price per unit of service
than grid connections in the same country.\cite{Mills:Specter,
Dutt:2004, vanderPlas:1988}
Chemical energy sources such as kerosene, candles, and dry cell batteries
are often used for lighting.
Kerosene, a very common lighting fuel, carries the drawbacks of heat,
soot, and fire risk.
While single-use chemical fuel is used for lighting, rechargeable
batteries are often used to power communication and entertainment devices
such as cellphones and televisions.
Since electrical energy production does not exist in most remote areas,
the devices themselves, or large rechargeable batteries, are instead
carried to stores that offer charging services.
Such recharging of cellphones and lead-acid batteries carry small
purchase costs, but the cost per unit of electricity is much higher than
that of electricity provided via a grid connection.
% 1.2.3
Wealthy consumers in some markets are able to purchase
solar home systems that provide modest amounts of convenient
power but these require a large initial investment.
In Kenya, investment in individual solar home systems has been
considerable, but such systems are primarily owned by the
wealthy.\cite{Jacobson:Connective}
Solar home system users in Bangladesh report that the costs of financing
associated with solar home systems are a hardship.\cite{Mondal:SHSBangladesh:2011}
At a lower price, solar lanterns with rechargeable batteries are available
and can provide light and cellphone charging but cannot provide 
power for television or other common demands.

% description and prior work
In an environment in which the most common affordable energy sources
have significant drawbacks and household electricity generation
services remain out of reach for most consumers, an opportunity for a
new service model arose.
By combining distributed generation with cellular communication, we
demonstrate that a modular microutility can deliver power to remote
locales using a robust prepaid collection system.
This effort is builds on previous work in prepaid electricity and
GSM-based communication in rural areas.
Prepaid metering for grid electricity has been successfully demonstrated
in South Africa and proven as a viable business model.\cite{Tewari:2003}
We also build on previous work using SMS to gather data from remote
areas.\cite{RapidSMS, Hartung:2010}
Also related are efforts to build autonomous metering systems using GSM
and SMS.\cite{Ramamurthy:2010}
Researchers have demonstrated a system for gathering of solar panel
electricity production and battery health over SMS networks.\cite{SimbaLink}
Simpa Networks is also providing a solar home system that can be
paid for in installments.\cite{Simpa}

% modular system can be deployed one at a time
Distributed solar generation, though costly, can be deployed gradually,
without the large lump expenditures required for grid extension.
% remote communications lowers o&m
By using the telecommunications networks that have been established in
many rural areas of developing countries, these systems can operate with
remote supervision and administration.
With customer billing and monitoring of the system done remotely
using wireless communications protocols such as SMS, the travel costs
to the site can be reduced by eliminating routine visits and restricting 
travel to necessary maintenance visits.
% attractive to investors
If manufactured at a cost-effective scale, this architecture could make
for an attractive business proposition for a utility, which could deploy
the systems as an alternative in areas where grid extension is
prohibitively expensive.
The concept is similar to that of a power-purchase agreement whereby an
outside investor provides the capital to pay for solar generation, while
the power is consumed by a private party that pays solely for the
electricity.
By focusing on an approach that aggregates several households together,
we hope to circumvent the difficulties of end-user finance by creating
an investment opportunity for an enterprise.
The selling of excess power from cellular towers is a similar idea to
this where the capital for energy generation is paid by a cellular 
communications provider and the electricity services are sold to consumers.
% data collection provides service to energy researchers
% data collection for research
Meanwhile, this architecture allows for the construction of a rich data
set on power consumption following the introduction of near-grid-quality
power to previously unelectrified sites.
Such data is of use to researchers and business people seeking an
understanding of energy purchasing patterns in rural, unelectrified
areas.

\section{Architecture}
% This section describes the implementation of this system
% this implementation of the systems allows for payment to be made prepaid
% we could apply any business model to this

This section describes how the system allows for the generation,
metering, distribution, and switching of photovoltaic-generated
electricity for consumption by households.
As implemented, the system allows power to be sold to consumers on a
pre-paid basis.
Each generation and metering system provides power to a small network of
up to 20 homes.
Payment and monitoring takes place via local cellular networks, with
commerce functions performed by a central server that allows for the
remote administration of multiple generation and metering systems.
Figure \ref{NetworkDiagram} shows a schematic of multiple systems delivering
power networked to a central server.

\begin{figure}[]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/NetworkDiagram.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Diagram of a network of meters and customers administered by a central server.
Multiple meters communicate via SMS messages that are relayed through a short message
service center (SMSC).  These messages are received by a server running the Kannel gateway
software that relays the messages in HTTP format to a server.  Customer messages also
communicate through SMS and the SMSC before messages are sent to the server.}
\label{NetworkDiagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generation, Metering, and Distribution}
% 2.2.1 power generation
Power is generated and distributed locally from a small central facility
placed near a group of 10 to 20 customers.
This facility consists of a weatherproof structure to protect the
electronics, solar panels, batteries, a power conditioning unit (PCU),
and three custom cabinets containing metering and communications
electronics.
Figure \ref{ShedWiringDiagram} shows the power flow and voltage levels 
between the generation and
metering components and the households.
The DC components of the system are 48V and power is delivered to 
consumers at 230 VAC.

\begin{figure}[]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/ShedWiringDiagram.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Power Generation and distribution.
Power is generated by an array of photovoltaic panels.
Output of these panels is used to charge a bank of batteries.
An inverter is powered by the batteries and power is distributed
through busbars and meters before distribution to the households.}
\label{ShedWiringDiagram}
\end{figure}

The central facility is approximately two meters by 
two meters by three meters tall
with solar panels mounted on the roof.
Electricity generation is provided by an eight-panel array of 175 W
monocrystalline panels, yielding 1.4 peak kW (Sharp NT-R5E3E 24 V 175 Wp).
The array power is received by the power conditioning unit inside the
structure, which carries out the functions of battery charging and
conversion to AC power.
The PCU (PPS Enviro Power, Single Phase SOLA ECO Inverter) contains a
battery charger, inverter, maximum power point tracker, generator input,
and an RS-232 interface for data collection.
The inverter supplies power to the system and the customers at 230 V and
50 Hz.
Power produced while the sun is shining is stored in a bank of valve
regulated lead acid (VRLA) (HBL T Series Tubular Gel VRLA 48 V 360 Ah)
batteries.
This battery bank provides power to the inverter during the nighttime hours.
The output from the inverter is fed into the first of the three custom
cabinets.
The first cabinet is the control enclosure which contains communications hardware and a plug computer.
As shown in Figure \ref{Enclosure}, power enters this control enclosure,
where it is measured in order to monitor the total power consumption of the
system.
The AC power is then distributed from the central control enclosure to
each of the two metering enclosures.
% 2.2.2 power distribution
Inside the two metering enclosures, the power is distributed by bus bars
and is individually metered before being sent to households.
Each metering enclosure is capable of distributing metered power to up
to 10 households, which are individually wired to a meter in a star
topology where each house has an individual wire running to the generation
site.
Each connected household is provided with two energy-efficient light
bulbs (5 W Philips LED), switches, and a plug outlet for appliances.
% 2.2.3 SC20
% 2.2.4 thread_ssmeter.py
% metering
% information flow
Power to each of up to 20 households flows through a commercial metering
product (Smart Circuit SC20, EED) that communicates via an ethernet
interface.
This device measures consumed power and switches the power supply on and off.
Each metering enclosure has 10 SC20 devices on an ethernet switch, which is connected to another
ethernet switch in the control enclosure.
A Linux plug computer, \mbox{(SheevaPlug)} which is connected to the switch,
runs a custom Python software application to monitor loads, switch
circuits and communicate with a central server.
The plug computer polls each of the 20 meters as well as the main meter for
power consumption data.
Information on each household's balance of remaining credit is stored on
the computer.
As power is consumed, credit is subtracted from each account according to the
per-kilowatt-hour price of electricity.
% pricing
The custom metering software allows for the electricity tariff to change
based on the time of day, the instantaneous power drawn, or the overall
daily energy demanded.

\begin{figure}[]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/Enclosure.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Schematic of the power and information flow in the metering hardware cabinets.
Power flows from the inverter to a main metering circuit.  The power is then distributed
by bus bar to up to 20 individual metering and switching circuits.  Information is collected
from each of these metering and switching circuits via an ethernet network and is aggregated
on a plug computer.  The plug computer controls the accounting and communication functions
and communicates with the central server by a GSM modem.}
\label{Enclosure}
\end{figure}


This software also controls communication between the local system and
the remote server.
The system communicates with a central server via SMS messages sent over
the GSM network.
At hourly intervals, the computer sends the accumulated daily
consumption of each household to a central server for storage in a
central database for later data retrieval.
% reporting
% communication
% responding
The meter also listens for messages from the central server over the GSM network.
These messages include commands to add credit to an account or to turn
a circuit on or off.
% configuration interface

% 2.3 customer-gateway-meter level
\subsection{Communication}
The proposed architecture allows multiple installation sites to be
monitored and administered from a central server.
The central server communicates with customer cellphones and the
local meters using HTTP and SMS messaging over the GSM
network.
For communication to occur between either the customer and the server
or between the meter and the server, a gateway is needed between
the GSM network and the internet.
The gateway can either be provided by the local telecommunications operator
or by employing custom software in conjunction with a modem.
In Mali, we initially used the latter to relay messages from SMS
directly to HTTP before contracting with the local telecom operator to
create a service that converts SMS messages to Short message
peer-to-peer (SMPP) messages.
The local telecommunications operator can provide a system that is
more reliable than our custom solution by housing it in a 
location with more robust power and communications.
A custom server running the Kannel package forwards
these SMPP messages from the local telecom to our central server over HTTP.
This system's server uses a Python-based Web application and a
PostgreSQL database to store information received from customers and
meters on their power consumption.
The server also has a web interface (Figure \ref{gateway}) that allows for
the configuration of consumers' circuits and a visualization of their
electricity consumption.

\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/gateway.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Screen shot of the administration interface.  This web application allows
the administrator to view the information collected from the installed systems.  Information
on the household electricity consumption and credit purchases can be viewed.  }
\label{gateway}
\end{figure}

% 2.4 transaction descriptions
\subsection{Transaction and Reporting Descriptions}
The system uses the functions described (generation, metering,
switching, and communication) to create a pre-paid microutility that
builds on the successful and locally familiar model of pre-paid cellular
phone air time.
% purchase
To purchase power, the customer buys a scratch-card from a local vendor.
Scratch cards (Figure \ref{scratchCards}) are available locally in
amounts as low as \$1 USD  and as high as \$4 USD.
The cards contain instructions on how to recharge the buyer's account
and a concealed authorization code.
The customer enters the revealed code into his mobile phone and sends it by
SMS to the central gateway server for validation.
Once validated, the gateway server sends a message to the local meter
instructing it to add the scratch card's credit amount to the
customer's account.
The meter sends an acknowledgment back to the gateway that credit has
been added, and the gateway in turn notifies the customer by SMS that
the transaction has been successful.
The consumer can then access electricity until her credit is exhausted,
at which time the household meter automatically turns off its relay.

% consumption
As energy is consumed, the plug computer reduces the consumer's credit accordingly.
When the credit level reaches a low setpoint, a message is sent to the
gateway server, which in turn sends a message to the consumer warning that her account is low and should be refilled soon.
% inquiry
Customers are also able to interact with their accounts to inquire about
their balance via SMS.
The customer sends a text message to the server, which responds back
with a message containing her credit balance.
She can also send a message to the gateway requesting that the household's
connection be turned on or off.
This allows the customer to protect against unauthorized power use
during an absence.

% meter initiated
The system is programmed to collect and store information about customer
electricity consumption on the central server.
Hourly, a message is sent from the central server to the gateway
containing information on each household's accumulated daily energy
usage.
The meter can also send data regarding photovoltaic energy production
and battery voltage.
% explain the implications of this section
To guard against depleting the batteries, the meter can shut off a consumer
circuit that is using more electricity than the system is designed for.
The meter software can turn off electricity to the household if the consumer's
power or daily energy is over an agreed maximum.
% gateway initiated
The meter also listens for incoming SMS messages from the gateway,
which are often diagnostic requests.


\section{Discussion}
At the time of this writing, we have five systems installed in Mali
serving about 90 households with pre-paid electricity.
One of these systems is near a city and four of the systems are in the
Tiby Millennium Village.
This area is well suited for the system since it has
a plentiful solar resource and though remote, has dense settlement
patterns that allow for short wire distribution lengths.


\subsection{Installation}
The installation process began with an assessment of a potential site for
suitability followed by planning and installation.
Consumers were
approached about their willingness to pay a connection fee and a service
fee for electricity.
Those customers who agreed to these fees made an initial deposit
and were connected.
The connection fee of \$60 USD covers a wire from the central meter location
to the home, the internal wiring in the home, and two 5 watt LED light bulbs and a
power outlet.
Each customer has a unique wire running from the central meter location to
the home that is their property and responsibility.
Wires were primarily run underground in these installations.
The soft soil made digging trenches for installation more cost-effective than
installing utility poles.
Customers were also provided with a card with their account number.
They were instructed to save this account number since it would be used
for electricity purchase transactions.
% what else about the installation?


\subsection{Consumer Training}
Although consumers are familiar with mobile phone technology and the
purchasing of mobile phone airtime, we conducted trainings (Figure \ref{training})
to instruct consumers on account management.
These trainings were conducted to be sure that customers knew how to
purchase credit and inquire into their account using their mobile
phones.
Training sessions were conducted in Bambara, the local language, with
the help of translators.
% literacy / message simplification
At the training sessions, customers were provided with scratch cards (Figure
\ref{scratchCards}) that contained a numeric authorization code and
instructions for sending the code to the central server for
validation.
To purchase credit, the scratch card instructed customers to send a
short alphabetic command code, followed by their assigned account
number, followed by the authorization code.
This scheme was modeled after the purchase of cellphone airtime.
During training, customers reported that the combination of numbers and letters was
cumbersome to enter and that our instruction cards were verbose and
difficult to understand.
We also discovered that not all villagers in Mali were as
comfortable with SMS messaging as we initially assumed.
Anecdotally, we noticed a higher level of familiarity with SMS
among some of the younger members.
In response to these reports, we modified the format of our SMS messages
to adhere more closely to the messages used by cellphone providers for
recharge and eliminated letters from the message formats.
The most familiar message format is the USSD protocol used by
cellphone providers for users to manage their accounts.
Unfortunately, the USSD protocol used by the providers was not available
to us so we could not create a system that was identical to the existing
systems that the villagers had experience with.
In the future, most of these issues can be greatly simplified by integrating
with an existing mobile money solution.
% training / toll-free / lack of credit
In order to purchase credit or inquire about the balance on a customers
account, an SMS message must be sent.
During this training period we observed that while most people owned
cellphones, they often did not carry a balance of usable air-time on
their phones.
This validated our choice to provide a toll-free number for SMS messaging.

\subsection{Electricity Consumption}
Using the data collected on our server, we can examine the electricity
consumption patterns of the households participating in the project.
We start by looking at a typical consumption pattern for households.
% characterize Mali with income and expenditures
% power usage
% power usage low during the day
% walter - why axis lines trends exceptions recap
To understand the usage patterns of consumers during the day
we averaged the hourly power consumption 
Figure \ref{average_power} shows the averaged
hourly power readings for a single household in Mali 
over a period of one month.
In this figure we plot the average power over a one hour period
on the y-axis and the hour of day from 0--23 on the x-axis.
The box shows the mean power over the hour and the whiskers indicate
the standard deviation of the day to day readings.
The plot shows that most of the power consumed is at night with a 
wattage level that is consistent
with the use of the 5 watt LED light bulb that we provide.
During the day however, there is almost no electricity consumption.
This pattern of primarily daytime use necessitates battery storage 
of the photovoltaic energy generated.

\begin{figure}[]

\caption{Hourly power use averaged over one month of data.  Each datapoint is the
average power consumed for that hour over a time period of two weeks.  Error bars
indicate the standard deviation for the data set.}
\label{average_power}
\end{figure}

% most common usage at 10-15 watthours
To get a sense of the daily consumption levels in our Mali pilot sites,
we plot a histogram (Figure \ref{energyHistogram}) of the daily
energy consumed with the frequency being
the number of days that power was observed in any household.
This data is for one meter in one village, Tiby II, in the Tiby cluster
in Mali with 17 households connected.

The histogram shows that the most frequent
daily usage is in the range of 10--15 watt-hours.
This is equivalent to 2--3 hours of use of the 5 watt LED
light bulbs installed with the system.
The households that display usage above this level usually own an appliance
such as a television or radio.

Figure \ref{consumptionHistogram} shows the number of customers consuming
a given amount of credit monthly.  
The exchange rate is approximately 500 XCFA to \$1 USD.
The most frequent expenditure is from \$1 USD to \$1.5 USD.

\end{figure}

% uptime

% consumer percent of time with credit
%A prepaid architecture allows the consumer to choose if power is available.
This architecture for power delivery uses a prepaid model.
Customers must maintain a non-zero amount of credit in their accounts in order
to use electricity.
The histogram in Figure \ref{creditHistogram} plots the number of customer households
that have a given percentage of time with credit available.
Over half of the consumers maintain non-zero amounts of credit over 90\% of
the time.



\begin{figure}[]

\caption{Histogram of percentage of time customers have a positive non-zero balance
of available credit in their accounts.  The majority of customers have electricity
available in their homes over 90\% of the time.}
\label{creditHistogram}
\end{figure}

To understand if only consumers with higher expenditures on electricity
are able to maintain non-zero balances consistently, we plot the fraction of
time with credit available against the expenditure per household in
Figure \ref{scatterCreditTime}.
This plot
shows that some customers with both high and low expenditures are able
to keep credit available most of the time.
However, those customers with credit available for lower fractions of time had lower
monthly expenditures.

% 3.2 challenges
\section{Challenges}
We have identified several areas needing further work in order to have
a robust and economically viable system.  Problems with communication
can prevent consumers from replenishing their accounts causing 
an interruption of service and frustration.  Also, excessive
power consumption by the meter and communication electronics diverts
electricity from consumers and requires extra generation costs.

% 3.2.1 reliability/robustness
% two issues: network reliability, modem hangs
\subsection{Network Reliability}
These systems are intended to run uninterrupted and unattended in
remote locations.  Communication uptime is very important.  We have
observed problems with communications reliability and latency.
Problems with network reliability have prompted us to explore other
means for information flow in the presence of intermittent connectivity.
We are considering both queueing information until the network becomes
available as well as using physical information movement such as flash
drives.

% 3.2.2 installation costs
% why did we use star topology vs bus distribution?
\subsection{Installation Costs}
For this system of electricity payment to make an impact on electricity
distribution, the economics must be appropriate.

Metering and communications add to the capital cost of the system.  
In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we used commercially available 
electronics to provide the prepaid functions at a cost of approximately
\$250 USD per household.
This cost includes the meters, relays, modems, computer, and enclosures but 
does not include the power generation, storage, or distribution.
These generation costs are important, but are common to any efforts at 
rural electrification.
We are developing custom hardware that can be manufactured at a cost
of \$30 per customer in quantities of 1000.
Also, this system requires skilled engineers for the server and communications
maintenance.  
The additional salary of these individuals must be added to the cost of 
electricity delivered.
The last cost unique to this type of delivery system are the scratch cards
and the data traffic to create a prepaid commerce system.
Currently we are using custom printed scratch cards and SMS messages 
purchased at retail costs. 
A scalable system would include partnerships with local telecom providers
to cheap data rates and access to mobile money networks for a commission.

Another challenge is reducing the cost of wires for power distribution.
In Mali, nucleated settlement patterns make it easier to wire homes but
other rural areas have longer inter-household distances that make 
distribution costs important.
We use a star topology for power distribution where each household has an
uninterrupted line to the meter.
The main reason for this
choice was clearly define the boundaries of ownership between the utility
and the consumer.
In the current model of the system, the consumer pays for
and owns the wiring leading from the central production shed.  Any tampering
of the wire will result in lost power for the consumer rather than lost
revenue for the utility.  This reduces the risk of one common type of fraud
and uses social pressure as a deterrent.
One disadvantage to this approach is the potentially higher cost of distribution.
A bus distribution scheme would in most cases lower the total length of
cable needed.  However, long sections of above-ground and accessible
utility-owned cable are vulnerable to unauthorized splicing.
This could be mitigated by monitoring along the network but would increase
the complexity of the system.

% 3.2.3 parasitic consumption and minimum detectable power
\subsection{Parasitic Consumption}
Any electricity that is consumed by the metering, communication, and 
switching components adds to the capital cost for energy generation and 
storage.
We have chosen commercially available components for integration into
these systems.  
The metering components are designed for developed markets
and consume 1.5 W--2.5 W.  
This power consumption is acceptable in markets where the loads are 
usually on the order of 100 W but are not well suited for the more modest
energy consumption in these rural areas.  
The off-the-shelf metering and switching electronics consumes 50W of power
or 1.2 kWh of AC energy daily.  
Approximately 80\% of this consumption is due to these metering units.
As a result, the electronics that provide the metering functions to the 
system consume the same amount of electricity per day that the consumers do.
This consumption can be reduced by the development of metering units with
lower power consumption, which we believe could operate at 0.25W 
continuous load.
If the meter consumption per household is brought to 0.25W, the daily
use is 6Wh.
If the same household uses a 5W light bulb for 5 hours each day, the fraction
of energy spent on metering is 20\%.
These lighting only customers place a upper bound on the fraction of generation
necessary for the metering and communications. 
Thus, this metering may not be cost effective for a household that only
uses lighting services.

Another aspect of the electronics that influences the economics of the system
is the lowest amount of power the meter can detect.
The commercially available meter we use cannot detect a load below 2.0 W.
An undetected 0.5 W vampire load of a
cellphone charger can consume 12 Wh in a day, equivalent to over 2 hours
of LED lighting.  
If this load is not measured, there
is no possibility of collecting revenue and we have generation capacity
that cannot be amortized.  



\section{Future Work}
Our work so far has been concerned with the
provision of solar electricity with low operating costs and robust revenue
collection.
However, the framework we have constructed allows for a much
richer set of features.
% demand response
A demand response system using text messages and discounts
would be straightforward to implement within this framework
by incorporating logic at the meter or central server that
could monitor the energy generation, send demand response
requests to customers, and credit accounts accordingly.
% other applications
In this pilot study, solar electricity is the good that
is being metered and delivered by our
system.
It is also possible to adapt this to architecture
to the provision of other generation technologies like hydropower or
diesel generation.  
Application to other easily metered and valuable goods
like purified water is also possible.
Such a clean water kiosk could enable carefully measured amounts 
of water to be provided in an automated fashion.
% open monitoring platform
The open software tools we have developed can also be adopted for
remote monitoring.  
This work could be adapted to create server storage of weather stations,
agricultural monitoring, or other measurements where GSM coverage exists.
To address the problems of power consumption by the meter,
we are developing custom electronics that have lower power consumption
and are capable of measuring loads below 1 watt.



\section{Conclusion}
We have designed and deployed a system that allows for the deployment
of microutilities in remote areas.  
These microutilities can be monitored
and administered by a central server.  
Approximately 170 households in Mali and 38 in Uganda are purchasing 
solar-generated electricity using this prepaid business model. 
Since communication takes place
over the GSM networks via SMS messages, these microutilities can be
deployed anywhere that GSM coverage exists.
